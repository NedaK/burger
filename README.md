# EAT-DA-BURGER!

### Overview

This application is a burger logger, created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It follows the MVC design pattern, and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app. Handlebars is used to generate the HTML, and Bootstrap is used for styling.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
